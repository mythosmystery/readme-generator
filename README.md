## Installation 
Simply clone the repo from github and navigate to it. Then run `npm i` which will install all npm plugins needed for the app.

  
## Usage
Run `npm start` to start it. Answer the prompts and when certain sections come up you will be dropped into your editor of choice to enter more detailed information about the section. 

  
## Configuring
There are three arrays in the `index.js` file that can be easily modified to change the prompts. The `generateMarkdown.js` file can be modified to change the markdown that the program outputs.


## Technologies Used

* VSCode markdown preview
